Python Compiler Discord Bot

As coders, we often find ourselves sharing snippets of code through Discord. While effective for casual coding, it can be tedious having to copy and paste this code into our own IDE's in order to run it. Our product, Compiler Cal has been created to help solve this problem. Our Discord Bot is a beginner-friendly Python and Javascript compiler that allows individuals to directly compile their code in Discord. With an ever increasing amount of online learning brought upon by the pandemic, we also believe that our product could help with running coding workshops through Discord.

Bot is made in Python using library discord.py. Libraries sys and subprocess are used to compile code using local terminal, returning output to the bot. A website previewing the project is available at https://joshuageddes.github.io/Compiler-Bot/
